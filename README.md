Conventional Commit Validator
================================================================================

This repository contains a parser used to validate that commit messages conform
according to my preferred standard, which is a slight modification of the
emerging
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard
that you totally should be using for your projects.

Note that this project is not yet ready for use. When I finish it I'll probably
integrate it into my CMake [starter
project](https://github.com/hendrik-s-debruin/cmake_base).

Why Write My Own Parser
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are more mature tools available for validating commit messages, and you
should probably look into those if you are looking for something like this. I
started this project since I have some preferences on top of the conventional
commit standard that are not checked by established tools. Furthermore, this
project is more a personal learning project. I have for some time been
interested in learning how to design programming languages, but have not yet had
the time to properly study the subject. I do, however, have some rudimentary
background information about the topic that I have gained from idly reading
about the topic in free moments. This project is therefore an attempt to see how
far I can get writing a parser using only the background knowledge I have
gained. I will probably rewrite this project properly once I have read up on the
topic in more depth.
